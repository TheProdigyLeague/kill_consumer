**You people need to have quantum versions only.** My project only supports quantum versions with zero security.

## Vuln -Xploit

**You report vulnerabilities by selling them to your local LEO.**

But, if you insist on reporting your latest exploits to our federal informants:

* You must report it to the secret service immediately.
* They will then investigate (You) and your family.
* If accepted: They will then sell it to data brokers.
* If declined: An appropriate subpeona of your private records will be rendered thenceforth.

You will not be updated.
